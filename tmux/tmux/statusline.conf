# Status line configuration.
# For now, we let the Catppuccin theme handle most of the styling.
# We'll customize this in the next step with:
#   - host identity
#   - SSH indicator
#   - git change summary
#   - current directory
#   - synchronized-pane indicator

# As a placeholder, you might want to ensure the status bar is enabled:
set-option -g status on
